**Purpose**<br>
On 31 December 2019, the local authorities of Wuhan (China), reported a cluster of pneumonia cases which turned out to be caused by [a novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)[[_Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2)]. By March 2020 the virus has already spread in over 80 countries outside China. On 30 January 2020 the WHO declared the recent COVID-19 outbreak as [a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)).

With this call for proposals we wish to contribute to the global response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Our aim is to support research that will enable us to understand and contain the new COVID-19, as well as to improve efficient patient management and public health (national and international) preparedness and response to the current and analogous outbreaks that may come in the future.
